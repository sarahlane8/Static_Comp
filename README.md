## Static Comp
In front-end developing, it is often necessary to match a designer's layout, including format, font styles, color palettes, and more.  This challenged me to experiment with flexbox and grid CSS properties, as well as creating breakpoints so the page can be viewed across devices.


Here is the original comp:

Future Considerations:  
  * Refactor CSS to be DRY
  * Add another breakpoint where sensible
  * Be sure page is fully accessibly and intuitive across devices
  * Match font styles more closely to comp
